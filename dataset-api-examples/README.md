# Dataset API Examples Project 

This is a maven project illustrating how to use the Dashbuilder's DataSet API. Several test classes containing the API examples are available:

* [BeanDataSetTest](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder-developers/tree/master/dataset-api-examples/src/test/java/org/dashbuilder/dataset/BeanDataSetTest.java): Bean based data set generation, registration and query 
* [CSVDataSetTest](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder-developers/tree/master/dataset-api-examples/src/test/java/org/dashbuilder/dataset/CSVDataSetTest.java): CSV data set registration and query
* [DataSetDefDeployerTest](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder-developers/tree/master/dataset-api-examples/src/test/java/org/dashbuilder/dataset/DataSetDefDeployerTest.java): Set up the datasets directory auto-deploying mechanism 

Further instructions on how to configure a project as well as how to use the API can be found [here](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder/tree/master/dashbuilder-backend/dashbuilder-dataset-core).

The [tests](https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder/tree/master/dashbuilder-backend/dashbuilder-dataset-core/src/test/java/org/dashbuilder/dataset) included in the Dashbuilder's dataset module are also a good source of knowledge about the proper API usage.
